## Projects Overview

### 1. Loan Prediction System
The loan prediction system uses machine learning algorithms to analyze applicant information and predict loan approval status. This helps financial institutions make faster and more accurate lending decisions.

**Features:**
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation
- Prediction functionality
- Performance metrics visualization

### 2. Image Classification System
The image classification system uses deep learning techniques to classify images into predefined categories.

**Features:**
- Image preprocessing and augmentation
- CNN model implementation
- Model training and evaluation
- Real-time prediction capabilities

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/KiranDhanvate/ShadowFox.git
cd ShadowFox
```

2. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the projects:

For Loan Prediction:
```bash
cd loan_prediction
python src/loan_prediction.py
```

For Image Classification:
```bash
cd image_classification
python src/image_classifier.py
```

## Technologies Used
